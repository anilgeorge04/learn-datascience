## What is efficient code?

1. Minimal Completion Time (fast runtime)
2. Minimal Resource Consumption (small memory footprint)

#### Pythonic Code
- Focus on Readability
- Use Python constructs as intended (ex: use list comprehensions)
Ref: Zen of Python by Tim Peters (Python Enhancement Proposal 20 or PEP20)
